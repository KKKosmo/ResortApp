# ResortApp

For a client who manages a resort

Made with JavaFX and Sqlite

Goal is to make it easier and secure to manage bookings, by having data enforcements and an intuitive modern GUI

Booking process got 10% faster and 80% more secure, resulting in them saving money and having faster processes

Most notable features are: an event history system, and generating detailed summary report PDF documents

Biggest challenges are security/auth, table filtering system, and efficiently retrieving and displaying data about the free slots available within a certain date range into the GUI (in which efficiency was boosted by doing dynamic programming)
