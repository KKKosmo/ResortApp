# ResortApp

The project that I am currently working on right now (Sept 2023). It uses Java and Sqlite, and it is about a desktop application that employees of a resort can use. The goal is to to make their work more secure and easier by letting them use a system that properly handles detailed booking records. It also has a good GUI and a feature for printing out reports.
