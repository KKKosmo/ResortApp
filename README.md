# ResortApp

- For a client who owns a resort
  
-A desktop application made with JavaFX and Sqlite.

-Goal is to make it easier and more secure for employees to manage bookings, by having data enforcements and a good GUI.

-Most notable features are: an event history system, and generating detailed summary report PDF documents.

-Biggest challenges are security/auth, table filtering system, and efficiently retrieving and displaying data about the free slots available within a certain date range into the GUI (in which efficiency was significantly boosted by doing dynamic programming).
