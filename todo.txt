index my table?

calendar controller should have a list of its days

maybe calendar should be a static scene, and just fill up the panes accordingly instead of instantiating calendar everytime?

entry date should be date time
entry date should be completely uneditable
multiple rooms can be selected
vehicle count

what should the report have?
    scrape off view
    change list columns (Look at docs)
    LIST AND SUMMARY SHOULD BE ONE, ADD TOTAL BOOKING AND PAYMENT TO LIST (Look at docs), make it kinda like the preview as well
    list should have a print button: PRINT PAGES 1-5
    edit history
    add column last modified, and its rows should be buttons to view data

edit should have a confirmation and the values changed popup

static list of users, and passwords, think about how to reset passwords








landscape
are abbreviated names fine
ask if balance should indicate paid or unpaid
user list





room fxml
inner room
room menu fxml
