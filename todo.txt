index my table?
if errors with sql, might be the plugins


list should display time in 12 hour format
list room selection must be a choicebox
LIST AND SUMMARY SHOULD BE ONE, ADD TOTAL BOOKING AND PAYMENT TO LIST (Look at docs), make it kinda like the preview as well
list should have a print button: PRINT PAGES 1-5
edit history
add column last modified, and its rows should be buttons to view data
list should have on hover to make it easier to see


saving list settings

static list of users, and passwords, think about how to reset passwords




text field lengths should be limited
vehicle field number only

check proper popups, a warning should not be the same as information
are u sure u want to delete this row -> row ID







recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.
