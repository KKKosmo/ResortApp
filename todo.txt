index my table?

edit should have a confirmation and the values changed popup
edit popup success popup should say successfully edited / no values changed

    see sqliteModel queryViewList(), it should return recordmodel object
    and its also to avoid passing lots of arguments, do same for others

what should the report have?
    scrape off view
    change list columns (Look at docs)
    LIST AND SUMMARY SHOULD BE ONE, ADD TOTAL BOOKING AND PAYMENT TO LIST (Look at docs), make it kinda like the preview as well
    list should have a print button: PRINT PAGES 1-5
    edit history
    add column last modified, and its rows should be buttons to view data


static list of users, and passwords, think about how to reset passwords



text field lengths should be limited




landscape
are abbreviated names fine
ask if balance should indicate paid or unpaid
user list

check proper popups


maybe calendar should be a static scene, and just fill up the panes accordingly instead of instantiating calendar everytime?
