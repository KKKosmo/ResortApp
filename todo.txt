if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

encrypt sql?

DESIGN
button mouse appearances

index my table

containerize

where do the files go? sql, creds, and reports

if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2


dont init list everytime



recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.



room fxml
inner room
room menu fxml

the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.

getting bugged by booked daycount
