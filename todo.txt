DESIGN
    what is first selected when entered scene
    button mouse appearances













Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
