if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

toggle button hover should be in code not css, with slow transition
on searchbar esc, esc text field

table start date should be after table end date

see if long strings will mess up print and table

change passsword -> confirm passwrod
max page bug


Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    show hide settings

    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
