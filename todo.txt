if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

test stress loading

say to not install in program files
say that if fully paid initially, put partial payment the same as full payment

Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    can i add a lil more personality maybe

    check if words are user friendly

    how to make it ok when installing in program files

	extra button click responsivity
    show hide settings

    add filter and to report:
        user
        name? prolly not

    filter, show status only paid/unpaid, pets/noPets, etc.

    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

    when clicked on calendar, go to table with those values

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
