index my table?
if errors with sql, might be the plugins

fix recordModel redundancy, see if the fields are even needed

what should the report have?
    scrape off view
    change list columns (Look at docs)
    LIST AND SUMMARY SHOULD BE ONE, ADD TOTAL BOOKING AND PAYMENT TO LIST (Look at docs), make it kinda like the preview as well
    list should have a print button: PRINT PAGES 1-5
    edit history
    add column last modified, and its rows should be buttons to view data


static list of users, and passwords, think about how to reset passwords




text field lengths should be limited
vehicle field number only

check proper popups, a warning should not be the same as information
are u sure u want to delete this row -> row ID







recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.
