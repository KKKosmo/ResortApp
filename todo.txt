if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

does it include sdk already?

think about folder structure, should sqlite be separate in its own folder?
should i really not encrypt key
proper folder location, src should only have key, sqlite, credentials(not there yet.)
then a folder for reports

how to install? -download installer from gdrive or some shit
what if data wanted to be reset? -reinstall
what if there are updates and i dont want the data to be cleared? -make a separate installer without the outside files
can i make it so that sql cant be extracted


print errors to log file how

encrypt sql?

DESIGN
button mouse appearances













Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime


Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
