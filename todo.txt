if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

exclusive room implementation in code

unit test, lots of data
    see if long strings will mess up print and table

Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    table date pickers order should not matter for user

    show hide settings

    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
