if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

add filter and to report:
    user
    name

total counting, sometimes the report from a month can overlap in another month

comment out system pritns

see partial paymern full payment overlapping
check if words are user friendly
test stress loading

instruct payment full paid

Would be nice but will not do due to time:
    filter, show status only paid/unpaid, pets/noPets, etc.

    how to make it ok when installing in program files

	extra button click responsivity

    show hide settings

    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

    when clicked on calendar, go to table with those values

    can i add a lil more personality maybe

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
