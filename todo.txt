if errors with sql, might be the plugins
if seem odd, might be because i tried to remove duplicates in controllers where they setAvailablesFotVisuals

optimize imports

how to update?
test stress loading

Would be nice but will not do due to time:
	extra button click responsivity
	
    table date pickers order should not matter for user

    show hide settings

    recordModel should be split into different inheriting classes
    recordModel should have a constructor that would take in an sql resultSet
    recordModel is supposed to make the code more readable, but i have no time and its working so its not really implemented well.

    the daymodels should have their own localdate fields, not a separate list.
    in edit history, look into sorting by time

    dont init list everytime

    encrypt key

    when clicked on calendar, go to table with those values

    can i add a lil more personality maybe

Will be needed for future?:
    if query more than 100 or sum, split into 2
